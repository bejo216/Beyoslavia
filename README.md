Project i started while spending 3 hours in transit everyday,
(C++)Text based survival-builder-politics game that i didnt finish, choose a race from a list from 17 races. The race gives you bonuses to stats and relations if the person you are interacting with is the same race. Random map generation with different tiles for each(grassland,mountains,swamp), and each tiles has a random number of villages which owners are of a certain race, each tiles theres a chance to spawn a town which you can interact.
Also theres custom hair and hats(like 50+) and each gives a stat also randomizes on persons u interact with. also every person is a random name-surname-race-age. Each race is a specific ASCII art i made(yeah i was that bored).
